# fintech-natural-language-processing

In this project, I use natural language processing techniques (sentiment analysis, etc.) to determine the prevailing sentiment of Bitcoin and Ethereum in online sources of recent times.

## Instructions / Intro

This Project consists of a single Jupyter Notebook which runs through the crypto sentiment (`crypto_sentiment.ipynb`) as described above.

To run through the Notebook, execute it and have a look at the word clouds and other graphical analysis tools produced, and of course ... draw your own conclusions.

All the data used in this Notebook is pulled from online sources which is a departure from other projects/repositories I have recently been involved in.
